## Typography

**Headings:** Playfair Display — elegant serif font that feels crafted and refined.

**Accent/Taglines:** Dancing Script — handwritten feel for a personal artisan touch.

**Body Text:** Lato Light/Regular — clean and easy to read for product descriptions and navigation.

## Layout

Clean product grid layout similar to Etsy. Large hero section on the homepage with a welcome message and featured items. Generous white space so products breathe and stand out. Consistent card design for all product listings.

## Navigation

Sticky top navbar in Bark Brown with cream text. Logo on the left, links in the center, cart and profile icons on the right. Mobile-friendly hamburger menu for smaller screens.

## Supabase Setup

This project includes a Supabase framework with graceful fallback to local sample data.

1. Open `.env.local`.
2. Add your project values:
	 - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
	 - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`)
	 - optional: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
3. Run the app with `pnpm dev`.
4. Check API connectivity at `/api/supabase/health`.

Current integration files:

- `src/lib/supabase/config.ts` - env handling
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` - browser client
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - server/admin clients
- `src/data/marketplace-supabase.ts` - Supabase-backed marketplace access

### Starter SQL (Supabase SQL Editor)

Use the canonical schema in [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql).

Quick copy/paste (same as the file):

```sql
create table if not exists sellers (
	id text primary key,
	name text not null,
	location text not null,
	specialty text not null,
	bio text not null,
	story text not null,
	"avatarEmoji" text not null
);

create table if not exists products (
	id text primary key,
	"sellerId" text not null references sellers(id),
	title text not null,
	category text not null,
	description text not null,
	price numeric not null,
	"imageEmoji" text not null,
	featured boolean not null default false
);

create table if not exists reviews (
	id text primary key,
	"productId" text not null references products(id),
	author text not null,
	rating int not null check (rating >= 1 and rating <= 5),
	comment text not null
);
```
